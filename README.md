# Language Game Project
[LIVE HERE](https://brieuc-language-game-905a4a54f0ba.herokuapp.com/)


Welcome to the **Language Game Project**! This project was created as part of my training at [Becode](https://becode.org) in September 2024. It marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.

Here are the full [guidelines](/guidelines.md).

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Language Game** is a simple game designed to test the user’s language skills by providing random words that need to be translated correctly. The project is built with **PHP** and adheres strictly to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.


## 📚 Main Achievements

- **OOP Structure**: 
  - Classes like `Player`, `Word`, and `Data` ensure a modular and reusable codebase.
- **MVC Architecture**:
  - **Model**: Handles game data (words, translations).
  - **View**: Renders the game interface and nickname form.
  - **Controller**: Processes game logic, form submissions, and score tracking.
- **Continuous Deployment**:
  - **Heroku and Git**: Synchronizing GitHub repository for continuous deployment.

## 🌟 Features

- **Nickname Input**: Users enter their nickname before starting the game, which is stored as the player’s name.
- **Random Word Translation**: Translate random words, with instant feedback.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores update based on correct or incorrect answers.
- **Game Reset**: Players can reset the game and start over with a new nickname.


## 🎓 Personal Achievement

This project represents a significant achievement for me as a student at **Becode**. It is the first time I have successfully implemented a project with strict adherence to the **MVC design pattern**. Throughout this project, I learned how to properly structure a PHP application by separating concerns, ensuring that the **Model** (data), **View** (UI), and **Controller** (logic) are properly decoupled.

I’m proud to say that this project reflects my newfound ability to follow **best coding practices** and **software architecture principles**, making this a milestone in my journey to becoming a professional developer.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **PHP**: Core programming language used to build the application.
- **Composer**: Dependency manager used for autoloading and managing third-party libraries.
- **Heroku**: Platform used to deploy the project.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform where the project is hosted.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Heroku** and can be accessed [here](https://your-heroku-app-url.com). The deployment follows the **PHP Composer** buildpack, ensuring that all dependencies are installed and the project is properly structured for cloud hosting.

🛠 Future Improvements

	•	Introduce a time-based challenge mode.
	•	Integrate a database to dynamically manage the list of words and translations.
	•	Improve the UI/UX for a more engaging user experience (CSS and JS).
