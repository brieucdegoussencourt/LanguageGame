# OOP introduction

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `varies`
- Team challenge : `solo with some team spirit added`

## The introduction

Inside this folder you'll find 3 OOP - `Object Orientated Programming` subrepos/folders that will guide and introduce you to the `OOP` paradigm.

Below you'll find the general guidelines for the whole `3.00P` folder, but keep in mind that each subfolder has its own `README.md` and requirements.

## The objective

Is to get you acquainted with `OOP`. This paradigm is language agnostic.

So even though the examples and exercices inside this repo are in `PHP`, **you are welcome and invited to**, do them in whatever language you choose, i,e: `JS, Ruby, PHP, ...etc`.

Keep in mind though, that not all languages have `classes` in their arsenal and even if they do, sometimes is best to just use plain `objects` or `factory functions` _hint hint J..._ ðŸ˜‰ but you can write your code as you see fit.
